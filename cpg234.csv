cpg234:scheme,skos:ConceptScheme,APRA CPG 234 Information Security June 2019,,"Prudential practice guides (PPGs) provide guidance on APRA's view of sound practice in 
particular areas. PPGs frequently discuss statutory requirements from legislation, 
regulations or APRA's prudential standards, but do not themselves create enforceable 
requirements. PPGs target areas where APRA continues to identify weaknesses as part of 
its ongoing supervisory activities, and do not seek to provide an all-encompassing 
framework, or to replace or endorse existing industry standards and guidelines.
This PPG aims to assist regulated entities in maintaining information security. It is designed 
to provide guidance to Boards, senior management, risk management and information 
security specialists (management and operational).
Subject to meeting APRA's prudential requirements, regulated entities have the flexibility to 
maintain information security in a manner best suited to achieving their business objectives. 
Not all of the practices outlined in this PPG will be relevant for every regulated entity and 
some aspects may vary depending upon the size and nature of the entity.",,,,,0.0.1,https://www.apra.gov.au/sites/default/files/cpg_234_information_security_june_2019_0.pdf
